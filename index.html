                  <h1>Do You Know ?</h1>
                  <p>We are the thinker behind the thought, the observer behind the observation, the flow of attention, the flow of awareness, the unbounded ocean of consciousness. We spontaneously realize that we have choices, and that we can exercise these choices, not through some sheer will power but spontaneously. Through meditation, we gradually bring harmony, laughter, and love back into our soul and, in the process, rediscover our unconditioned self, which can never really be lost.</p>

              <p>Dark and light exist side by side, even in the YogaPetz Resort. However, by the power of BREATHE, even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise. All Petz can access our Breathe to Earn game to earn $PRANA. You can use $PRANA in our marketplace and upgrade your Petz to fight against the darkness. What you need to do is just breathe.</p>
